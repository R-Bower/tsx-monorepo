# Core Concepts

This page lays out the fundamentals of building with our components.

## Responsive props
Instead of manually managing media queries and adding nested style objects throughout the codebase, we take advantage of [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system)'s responsive props API.  Styled System offers a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles with a mobile-first approach.

```jsx
<Box
  width={[
    1,    // 100% below the smallest breakpoint
    1/2,  // 50% from the next breakpoint and up
    1/4,  // 25% from the next breakpoint and up
  ]}
/>
```

The styled-components [css](https://styled-components.com/docs/api) prop should only be used as a last resort.

```jsx
import {css} from styled-components

const boxCss = css`
  width: 100px;
`

<Box css={boxCss} />
```

## Types of components

### Primitive Components

 Primitive components (referred to as Primitives) are basic building blocks that can be used together to create more complex components.  Each primitive contains a tailored set of [system-props](/system-props) which provide CSS-in-JS as props on the component.  Some examples of our primitives include `Box`, `Flex`, `Grid`, and `Text`.

### Complex Components

 Complex components are components that are made up of one or more building block components to represent a commonly used pattern or utility in our UI.  Each complex component belongs to a sub-group like `data-display`, `layout`, or `feedback`. Some examples of complex components are `TruncatedText` and `Card`.

Complex components are organized based on their category.  Some examples of this organization include `data display`, `inputs`, and `layout`.


 ## The `as` prop
 The `as` prop is a feature that all of our components get from [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com). It allows you to pass an HTML tag or another component to a Component.  That Component will be rendered as the base tag of the `as` variable along with all of its styles and props.


 For example, say you are using a `Button` component, and you really need to apply `Flex` styles to it. You can compose `Flex` and `Button` like so:

 ```jsx
 <Flex as={Button} href='https://github.com'>Hello</Flex>
 ```

 This will allow you to use all of the `Button` props _and_ all of the `Flex` props without having to wrap your `Button` component in another `Flex` component.

 **This pattern does have some limitations.** Usage of the `as` prop can lead to unexpected output. In the example above, if the user had done `<Button as={Flex}/>` instead, because the `Flex`'s render method is ultimately applied, and `Flex` components render `div`'s, you'll see that the rendered component is a `div` when ideally you'd like it to be a `button`. It is also not always clear how the styles in both components will interact and/or override each other.

For these reasons, **we recommend only using the `as` prop when you cannot achieve the same result by nesting components.** The `Flex` / `Button` example could be done like so:

```jsx
function Test() {
  return (
    <Flex>
      <Button href='https://github.com'>Hi</Button>
    </Flex>
  )
}

```
