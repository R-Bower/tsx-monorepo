# Core Concepts

This page lays out the fundamentals of building with our components.

## Responsive props
Instead of manually managing media queries and adding nested style objects throughout the codebase, we take advantage of [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system)'s responsive props API.  Styled System offers a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles with a mobile-first approach.

### Fundamentals
Each array value generates a min-width media query.

The first value of the array is the default value than spans from `0px` to the first breakpoint of the breakpoints theme field.
Each subsequent value corresponds to the breakpoints theme field, starting with the first breakpoint.

The following examples are based on our theme's default breakpoints configuration.  All values are in pixels.

`const breakpoints = [360, 550, 768, 1024, 1400, 1800]`

```jsx
<Box
  height={[
    28, // 0-359px: height = 28px
    32, // 360-549px: height = 32px
    36  // 550px and up: height = 36px
  ]}
/>
```

This translates to the following css:
```scss
.exampleClass {
  height: 28px;
  @media screen and (min-width: 360px) {
    height: 32px;
  }
  @media screen and (min-width: 550px) {
    height: 36px;
  }
}


```

To skip a breakpoint, supply null for that breakpoint's array index.

```jsx
<Box
  height={[
    28,   // 0-359px: height = 28px
    32,   // 360-549px: height = 32px
    null, // 550-767px: height = 32px
    36    // 768px and up: height = 36px
  ]}
/>
```

## Types of components

### Primitive Components

 Primitive components (referred to as Primitives) are basic building blocks that can be used together to create more complex components.  Each primitive contains a tailored set of [system-props](/system-props) which provide CSS-in-JS as props on the component.  Some examples of our primitives include `Box`, `Flex`, `Grid`, and `Text`.

### Complex Components

 Complex components are components that are made up of one or more building block components to represent a commonly used pattern or utility in our UI.  Each complex component belongs to a sub-group like `data-display`, `layout`, or `feedback`. Some examples of complex components are `TruncatedText` and `Card`.

Complex components are organized based on their category.  Some examples of this organization include `data display`, `inputs`, and `layout`.


 ## The `as` prop
 The `as` prop is a feature that all of our components get from [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com). It allows you to pass an HTML tag or another component to a Component.  That Component will be rendered as the base tag of the `as` variable along with all of its styles and props.


 For example, say you are using a `Button` component, and you really need to apply `Flex` styles to it. You can compose `Flex` and `Button` like so:

 ```jsx
 <Flex as={Button} href='https://github.com'>Hello</Flex>
 ```

 This will allow you to use all of the `Button` props _and_ all of the `Flex` props without having to wrap your `Button` component in another `Flex` component.

 **This pattern does have some limitations.** Usage of the `as` prop can lead to unexpected output. In the example above, if the user had done `<Button as={Flex}/>` instead, because the `Flex`'s render method is ultimately applied, and `Flex` components render `div`'s, you'll see that the rendered component is a `div` when ideally you'd like it to be a `button`. It is also not always clear how the styles in both components will interact and/or override each other.

For these reasons, **we recommend only using the `as` prop when you cannot achieve the same result by nesting components.** The `Flex` / `Button` example could be done like so:

```jsx
function Test() {
  return (
    <Flex>
      <Button href='https://github.com'>Hi</Button>
    </Flex>
  )
}

```
