# Core Concepts

This page lays out the fundamentals of building with our components.

## Responsive props
Instead of manually managing media queries and adding nested style objects throughout the codebase, we take advantage of [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system)'s responsive props API.  Styled System offers a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles with a mobile-first approach.

### Fundamentals
Each array value generates a min-width media query.

The first value of the array is the default value than spans from `0px` to the first breakpoint of the breakpoints theme field.
Each subsequent value corresponds to the breakpoints theme field, starting with the first breakpoint.

The following examples are based on our theme's default breakpoints configuration.  All values are in pixels.

`const breakpoints = [360, 550, 768, 1024, 1400, 1800]`

```jsx
<Box
  height={[
    28, // 0-359px: height = 28px
    32, // 360-549px: height = 32px
    36  // 550px and up: height = 36px
  ]}
/>
```

This translates to the following css:
```scss
.exampleClass {
  height: 28px;
  @media screen and (min-width: 360px) {
    height: 32px;
  }
  @media screen and (min-width: 550px) {
    height: 36px;
  }
}


```

To skip a breakpoint, supply null for that breakpoint's array index.

```jsx
<Box
  height={[
    28,   // 0-359px: height = 28px
    32,   // 360-549px: height = 32px
    null, // 550-767px: height = 32px
    36    // 768px and up: height = 36px
  ]}
/>
```

## Types of components

### Primitive Components

 Primitive components (referred to as Primitives) are basic building blocks that can be used together to create more complex components.  Each primitive contains a tailored set of [system-props](/system-props) which provide CSS properties as props on the component.  Some examples of our primitives include `Box`, `Flex`, `Grid`, and `Text`.

### Complex Components

 Complex components are components that are made up of one or more building block components to represent a commonly used pattern or utility in our UI.  Each complex component belongs to a sub-group like `data-display`, `layout`, or `feedback`. Some examples of complex components are `TruncatedText` and `Card`.

Complex components are organized based on their category.  Some examples of this organization include `data display`, `inputs`, and `layout`.


## The `as` prop
[styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) provides all of our components with the `as` prop. When passed to a component, that component will be rendered as the base tag of the `as` variable along with all of its styles and props.

```jsx
// Box renders as a div by default.
// This will change it to a span.
<Box as={"span"}>
  Hello
</Box>
```
