# Core Concepts

## System Props

Our React components use [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) to accept CSS variables as props.  Applicable props are transformed based on theme fields.

### Basics

Consider the following `<Box />` component which is enhanced with the `bg` style prop. This prop corresponds to the CSS `background-color` property.

```jsx live noToggle
<Box bg={"#CCAC67"}>
  Hello!
</Box>
```

This is equivalent to the following JSX/CSS:
```jsx
<Box className={"box"}>
  Hello!
</Box>
```
```css
.box {
  background-color: #CCAC67;
}
```

Many components get the `COMMON` set of props which give the component access to [BORDER](#border), [COLOR](#color), [DISPLAY](#display) [SIZING](#sizing), and [SPACE](#space) style props.  Refer to the [Props API](/props-api) page for each group.

## Responsive Props

Instead of manually managing media queries and adding nested style objects throughout the codebase, we take advantage of [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system)'s responsive props API.

Each system prop supports a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles with a mobile-first approach.

Array values generate min-width media queries which map to the `theme.breakpoints` configuration:

`const breakpoints = [360, 550, 768, 1024, 1400, 1800]`

```jsx
<Box
  height={[
    28, // 0-359px: height = 28px
    32, // 360-549px: height = 32px
    36  // 550px and up: height = 36px
  ]}
/>
```

This translates to the following css:
```scss
.exampleClass {
  height: 28px;

  @media screen and (min-width: 360px) {
    height: 32px;
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 550px) {
    height: 36px;
  }
}
```

To skip a breakpoint, supply null for that breakpoint's array index.

```jsx
<Box
  height={[
    28,   // 0-359px: height = 28px
    32,   // 360-549px: height = 32px
    null, // 550-767px: height = 32px
    36    // 768px and up: height = 36px
  ]}
/>
```


## The `as` prop
[styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) provides all of our components with the `as` prop. When passed to a component, that component will be rendered as the base tag of the `as` variable along with all of its styles and props.

```jsx
// Box renders as a div by default.
// This will change it to a span.
<Box as={"span"}>
  Hello
</Box>
```
