# Theme

Theming in this library is made possible by a `styled-components` theme object that defines the application's colors, breakpoints, spacing, fonts, and more.
(see `packages/libs/react-style-system`)

- By designing components around a universal theme, colors can be swapped and tweaked without fear of breaking existing components.

## Colors

The application's colors map to an interface that defines every element's available colors.  Elements are grouped based on their functionality.

Color groups are categorized based on the functionality of the elements within the group.  Examples include `text`, `icons`, and `backgrounds`.

#### Guidelines:
- When at all possible, favor using color utility classes over using custom CSS to set colors.
- You should only use colors designed for the element you're applying them to. For example, text colors should not be used for icons, backgrounds, or any other non-text element.

## Accessing theme values programmatically
There may be times when you need to access theme values directly.  Our theme is implemented through `styled-components`, which supports programmatic access through the `useContext` React hook:

```jsx
import {ThemeContext} from "styled-components"

function ExampleView() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)
}
```
