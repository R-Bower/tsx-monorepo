# Theme

Theming in this library is made possible by a `styled-components` theme object that defines the application's colors, breakpoints, spacing, fonts, and more.
(see `packages/libs/react-style-system`)

- By designing components around a universal theme, colors can be swapped and tweaked without fear of breaking existing components.

## Colors

Component colors map to an interface that defines the available color variables.  Elements are grouped based on their functionality.

Color groups are categorized based on the functionality of the elements within the group.  Examples include `text`, `icons`, and `backgrounds`.  For all available colors, check out the `@rb/react-style-system` package.

#### Guidelines:
- When at all possible, favor using color utility classes over using custom CSS to set colors.
- You should only use colors designed for the element you're applying them to. For example, text colors should not be used for icons, backgrounds, or any other non-text element.
- As a last resort you can provide any valid hex, rgb, or rgba color string.

#### Considerations
- The colors interface will change as components are added and adjusted.
