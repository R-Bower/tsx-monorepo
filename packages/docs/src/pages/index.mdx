# Overview

This React library is heavily inspired by GitHub's [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/).  It incorporates [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) to facilitate rapid, maintainable, and scalable component creation.

These docs are built using the components described within.  Take a look at the repository for examples!

Disclaimer: I shamelessly cloned Primer's site layout :)

## Principles

- Everything is a component.
- Build small building blocks with minimal props to keep complexity low.
- Keep system constrained by only including props needed per component.
- Favor wrapping or extending components for more complex operations.
- Maintain design system consistency with utilities as props (for spacing, color, font-size, line-height, widths, and radii).


## Goals and Focus

Our goal with this toolkit is to hit the sweet spot between providing too little and too much styling flexibility; too little and the design system is too rigid, and too much and it becomes too difficult to maintain a consistent style.

We're focusing primarily on presentational components that help standardize common design patterns. These components don't handle fetching and submitting data to/from APIs. If you'd like to handle data in one of these components, create a wrapper and pass the data to the presentational components.
