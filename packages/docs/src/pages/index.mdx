# Overview

This React library is heavily inspired by GitHub's [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/).  It incorporates [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) to facilitate rapid, maintainable, and scalable component creation.

These docs are built using the components described within.  Take a look at the [repository](https://github.com/R-Bower/tsx-monorepo) for examples!

The layout of this site is similar to Primer's React component docs, but appearances can be deceiving:
1. This site was reengineered from the ground-up using Next + TypeScript (Primer's docs are based in Gatsby + JavaScript).
2. Primer's styling solution uses vanilla `styled-system`.  Ours extends the `styled-system` TypeScript definitions types for optimal code completion/intellisense.  [Learn more](/why-styled-system#optimal-developer-experience).
3. Primer's docs sites and individual React libraries are standalone.  This library is a monorepo that melds all the React tooling into one convenient package.

## Principles

- Everything is a component.
- Build small building blocks with minimal props to keep complexity low.
- Keep system constrained by only including props needed per component.
- Favor wrapping or extending components for more complex operations.
- Maintain design system consistency with utilities as props (for spacing, color, font-size, line-height, etc...).


## Goals and Focus

Our goal with this toolkit is to hit the sweet spot between providing too little and too much styling flexibility; too little and the design system is too rigid, and too much and it becomes too difficult to maintain a consistent style.

We're focusing primarily on presentational components that help standardize common design patterns. These components don't handle fetching and submitting data to/from APIs. If you'd like to handle data in one of these components, create a wrapper and pass the data to the presentational components.

## Library overview
The repository is configured using Lerna and Yarn workspaces to link packages.  Each package maintains its own list of dependencies which are ultimately compiled and hoisted to the root node_modules directory.  The docs site you're on now primarily focuses on two packages:
1. `libs/react-components` - a shared React component library.
2. `libs/react-style-system` - the shared styling solution for React code in the repository.
