# The sx prop

The `sx` prop was implemented to provide developers with an alternative to `styled-components` CSS for pseudo selectors.  It should primarily be used for locking in styles on a reusable component or providing one-off CSS selectors to existing elements.

Much like our system props, it's theme-aware and will apply scales from our theme to each applicable prop.

```jsx live
<Text
  border={"none"}
  height={32}
  sx={{
    ":hover": {
      color: "text.tertiary"
    }
  }}
  width={75}
>
  Hover over me!
</Text>
```

### Best practices

With the SX prop, every available CSS property is valid.  While powerful, this is easy to abuse.  For example, using the SX prop you can provide props to components that don't accept that prop by default.  Consider the `Box` primitive which doesn't include any `TYPOGRAPHY` props.

```jsx
// just because you can doesn't mean you should.
<Box sx={{fontSize: 14}}>Hello</Box>
```

The SX prop is best used to apply styles that are otherwise impossible to apply using our system props.  Before using the SX prop, ensure that you can't apply the same styles using an existing component.

### Pattern abstraction
If you find yourself repeating the same pattern with the sx prop, consider extracting that styling logic into a standalone component.
