# System Props

Our React components utilize [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system)'s style functions to apply groups of props to each component.   These functions modify our components to accept CSS variables as props.

Many components get the `COMMON` set of props which give the component access to [BORDER](#border), [COLOR](#color), [DISPLAY](#display) [SIZING](#sizing), and [SPACE](#space) style props.  Refer to the [table](#style-props) below for every available group.
