# Box

The Box component serves as a wrapper component for most layout related needs. Use Box to set values such as `display`, `width`, `height`, and more. In practice, this component is used as a wrapper around other components to achieve Box Model related styling.

```jsx live
<Box
  bg={"bg.successInverse"}
  border={"solid 1px"}
  borderColor={"border.primary"}
>
  Box can be used to create both{" "}
  <Box as={"span"} bg={"bg.warningInverse"}>
    inline
  </Box>{" "}
  and
  <Box bg={"bg.dangerInverse"}>
    block-level elements,
  </Box>
  <Box
    bg={"bg.infoInverse"}
    p={4}
    mt={2}
  >
    and more!
  </Box>
</Box>
```

## System props

Box components get the `COMMON` category of system props which includes `BORDER`, `COLOR`, `DISPLAY`, `SIZING`, and `SPACE`. Refer to the table below for each property.

<StylePropsSearch propGroups={["border", "color", "display", "sizing", "space"]} />
