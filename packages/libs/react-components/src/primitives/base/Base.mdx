# Base

The `Base` primitive serves as a template for creating reusable components with predetermined styles.

### Best practices

Re: Goals and Focus - Our goal with this toolkit is to hit the sweet spot between providing too little and too much styling flexibility. Too little, and the design system is too rigid; too much, and it becomes difficult to maintain a consistent style.

In line with the focus of this toolkit, you should only use this component if you're creating a reusable component that has a predetermined style.

<StylePropsSearch propGroups={["sizing", "space"]} />
