## React Component Library

This component library is built using `styled-components` and `styled-system`.

- Documentation lives alongside each component as `.mdx` files.  MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.
- For more information about our MDX setup, check out the README at [packages/docs/README.md](../../docs/README.md)
