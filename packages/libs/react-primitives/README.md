I've spent the last few years setting up this library of style primitives for React.  To date, it's been used in 2 production applications (with varying degrees of customization) including https://www.qualcomm.com and https://www.nerdial.com.

This is the most recent rendition of the library written with first-class TypeScript support (previous versions being in JS).  While rebuilding the library in TypeScript, I stumbled on [@primer/react](https://primer.style/components/) which is extremely similar to what you'll see here!  I've taken many ideas from Primer while constructing this rendition.

Special thanks to Graeme Ross, Anthony Valera, Jim Beaver, and Michael Park for introducing me to this type of CSS in JS solution.
