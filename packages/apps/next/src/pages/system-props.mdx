}

Primer React components utilize what we call "system props" to apply a standard set of props to each component. Using [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system), groups of props are automatically applied to each component. Most components get the `COMMON` set of props which give the component access to color and space props (margin, padding, color and background color). These groups correspond to the `color` and `space` functions from `styled-system` which can be referenced in the styled system [table of style functions](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/blob/master/docs/table.md#core).

To check which system props each component includes, check the documentation for that component.

### The ```as``` prop
All Primer React components have access to the `as` prop, provided by [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#as-polymorphic-prop). We use the `as` prop to render a component with the styles of the passed component in `as`, but with the system props of the base component.

For example, if you wanted to add some flex utilities to the `Text` component, you could do:

```jsx live
<Text as={Flex}>Hello!</Text>
```

export default ({children}) => <MDXPageWrapper meta={meta}>{children}</MDXPageWrapper>
