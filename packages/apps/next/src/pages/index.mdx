# Overview

This React library is loosely based off of GitHub's [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/).  It incorporates [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) to facilitate rapid, maintainable, and scalable component creation.

## Principles

- Everything is a component.
- Build small building blocks with minimal props to keep complexity low.
- Keep system constrained by only including props needed per component.
- Favor wrapping or extending components for more complex operations.
- Maintain design system consistency with utilities as props (for spacing, color, font-size, line-height, widths, and radii).

## Considerations

These docs are built using the components described within.  Take a look at the repository for examples!
