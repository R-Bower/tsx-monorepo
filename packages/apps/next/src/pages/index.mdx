This React library is heavily inspired by GitHub's [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/) ðŸŽ‰

## Principles

- Everything is a component.
- Build small building blocks with minimal props to keep complexity low.
- Keep system constrained by only including props needed per component.
- Favor wrapping or extending components for more complex operations.
- Maintain design system consistency with utilities as props (for spacing, color, font-size, line-height, widths, and radii).
